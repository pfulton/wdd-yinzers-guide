# Yinzer's Guide 2018

Usually, city guides are pretty terrible/paid for. A few years ago, some of us yinzers (Pittsburghers) put together a handy guide for [Web Design Day 2016](http://www.webdesignday.com/), and now we've updated it for 2018!

### General Stuff

If you're staying near downtown or the North Side/North Shore area, many of the things here will be within walking distance. If not, Pittsburgh's [bike share program](https://healthyridepgh.com) can get you there, along with the standard Uber/Lyft options. Regular taxi service, like hailing a cab, generally doesn't work. Seriously, it's terrible.

If you've never been to Pittsburgh before, make it a priority to get to Mount Washington to see the city from Grandview Avenue. We have info on that below.

If you're wondering what Pittsburgh is all about, a great introduction to the city are the [Rick Seback](www.twitter.com/rickaroundhere) videos, which you can [find on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_BOhAzWiVfmeIIntHzz8LAt7bS0Ipd31). This guy is an institution. Or, you could just ask any Pittsburgher. Pittsburghers love to talk about Pittsburgh- it's part of living here.

### Strip District
The Strip is where Pittsburgh goes to get...pretty much anything. Steelers shirt? Yep. Random imported Italian cheese? Got it. Cannoli? Boom. Mung bean pancakes? Got you covered. Come hungry.
